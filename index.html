    <h1>Love what you wear and find a place for what you don’t.</h1>

    <h2>Hello!</h2>
    <p>You+She is an online market dedicated to buying, selling, discussion, and discovery of female-founded, romantic
      brands.
      We love all things of beauty and we care about the quality, sustainability and ethics of the brands. Over the
      years, we
      have been collecting the brands that are beautiful both inside and out. We highly recommend them to you and are
      providing our support via this secondhand market.</p>

    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>Kait and Yuxi (you-she) met on Instagram and bonded over our shared love of fashion. We have talked about
      clothing for
      years and discovered how transformative thoughtfully-crafted pieces have been in our lives. As mothers of young
      kids
      we’ve found fashion helpful in our personal journeys. From wearing a soft nightgown while up in the middle of the
      night
      to feeling like the Belle of the ball at an event in a romantic gown. Our clothing is an important part of our
      lifestyle.</p>
    <p>After selling our clothing in numerous ways online we decided to create a space dedicated to reselling beautiful
      brands
      to the stylish community that we love to be a part of. We hope to create a positive space where people can collect
      heirloom pieces, chat about clothing, and create friendships. We would love to
      share our
      passion by sharing reviews of our heirloom pieces and newly discovered jewels as post or story.</p>

    <h2>Buying Guidelines</h2>
    <p>Buying is simple and safe at You+She!! We require sellers to price based on the condition determined
      according to
      our standards and also disclose known flaws. All Paypal transactions are protected by utilizing the Goods &
      Services option.

    <h2>Selling Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Prepare your item.
        <ol class="roman">
          <li>Inspect your item carefully for flaws and marks.</li>
          <li>Clean your item. Please DO NOT submit an item with a hygienic issue.</li>
          <li>Photograph your item. Please use good natural lighting to accurately reflect its condition. All known
            flaws need to be
            photographed and revealed to the buyer. Do not apply filters that interfere with the true representation of
            the color.</li>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Types of photos:</strong></li>
            <li>At least two real photos of the item taken by the seller (please do not borrow photos). Extra points for
              a picture of
              yourself in the item!
              We would love a close-up “swatch” pic of the fabric and pretty print that you’re listing! Let’s appreciate
              the
              details.</li>
          </ul>
          <li>Determine the condition. To make sure the buyer receives items in the condition they expect we stress the
            accuracy of
            reporting the state of your item. Please see below for our terminology. Your post will be delayed and asked
            to be
            reworded if the terminology below is not followed.
            <ol class="alpha">
              <li><strong>A</strong> - New: never worn, tag is on</li>
              <li><strong>B</strong> - Pristine: tried on only, tag is removed</li>

            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>Determine the price. Pricing should be based on the condition determined in (iv), factoring the popularity
            and the 3% Paypal fee. Price gouging is NOT allowed under any circumstances.</li>
          <ul class="alpha">
            <li><strong>A</strong> - Above retail is allowed (suggest price at cost or lower)</li>

        item.
        In the case of leaving "zipcode with pending question", please reply to the question and you are allowed to move
        on
